  "message": "Thanks for the details.  Unfortunately I have not had the chance to play with this utility on PeopleTools 8.53.  I have only used it on 8.55 and 8.56.  It is likely that your Tools version is what is causing the error.  Hopefully someone else will chime in with their experiences of using this utility on older Tools to confirm this.\n\nIn the meantime I would suggest exploring if there are any delivered usages of %Metadata:PeopleCodeProgram in your 8.53 environment.  You can go to App Designer > Edit > Find In..., paste in \"%Metadata:PeopleCodeProgram\" in the \"Find What\" field, select \"Entire Database\" for the \"Project\" field, and click the Find button.  This will show you if the delivered code makes use of the PeopleCodeProgram sub package.  If you happen to find references, then look and see if they ever call the \"UpdateProgram\" method.  This will tell you the proper usage of the method for the Tools that your environment is on.  It is possible that it is something simple like the method taking fewer parameters in the older Tools than in the Tools that I created this utility in.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions and if you are able to get this to work.",
