What I want to do next is to save the generated QR Code(.svg) as an image (.jpg) into the database as a blob. The end-goal that I would want to achieve is have the QR code printed in the PDF output of my BI Publisher.\r\n\r\nI tried converting the .svg file to base64, and had the field in the RTF template coded below but still did not work:\r\n<fo:instream-foreign-object content-type=\"image/svg+xml\">\r\n <xsl:value-of select=\"fld_PT_URLTEXT\"/>\r\n</fo:instream-foreign-object>",
