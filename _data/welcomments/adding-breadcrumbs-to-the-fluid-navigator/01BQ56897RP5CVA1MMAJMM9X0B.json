I was not aware that this functionality caused these exceptions.  \r\n\r\nI will try to look into this and see if I can come up with a way to not make these exceptions occur.  In the meantime, you could try asking this to the experts on the Oracle PeopleSoft Community forum (https://community.oracle.com/community/oracle-applications/peoplesoft_enterprise/peoplesoft_general_discussion) or see if you can get assistance from an Oracle representative in My Oracle Support.",
