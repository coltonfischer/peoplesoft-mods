  "message": "I would like to think that this solution can be coded to allow for breadcrumbs to display for remote content, but I do not have an environment configured with Unified Navigation to actually test this on.  After analyzing the delivered code some, I would suggest that you look in the following two classes:\r\n\r\n1.\tPTNUI:NavBarContentArea:Content:Menu\r\n2.\tPTUN_UNINAV:RemoteMenu:RemoteMenu \r\n\r\nThe Menu class indicates that there are Unified Navigation-specific Request parameters (\"UNINAV\" and “UNNODE”) that get passed in on the click of the remote content menu items.  These two parameters are what ques the code to generate the RemoteMenu object.  The RemoteMenu class is the object representation of a Remote Registry using the Unified Navigation.  From there, you might be able to fetch the needed values to properly display the breadcrumb.\r\n\r\nI think if you poke around the delivered code in these classes, then you can get an understanding of how the remote content menu items are generated.  This will give you an idea on how to alter the event mapped code in this post so that it can create/display breadcrumbs for the remote content menu items.  Feel free to reach out with any other questions and please let me know if you are able to figure this out.",
