  "message": "Very helpful!  I did find that the breadcrumbs don't generate if you are going from a fluid homepage, clicking on a tile, then going to a component. It only generates as you navigate from the Root of the menu.  Would be cool to have that auto-generate the menu of where the underlying component in the Tile resides.  Anyway, thank you for sharing this!",
