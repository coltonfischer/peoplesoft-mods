  "message": "Hi Joanna.  I have experienced this on a PeopleTools 8.55.12 system.  I found that it has to do with the use of the AddStyleSheet function.  When I commented out all of the calls to the AddStyleSheet function in the StyleBreadcrumbs class, the spinner does not linger.  However, the additional styles injected with the AddStyleSheet function is what really makes this solution usable so not injecting the styles is not really an option.\n\nI would like to note that this does not occur in PeopleTools 8.56.01.  It is possible that this may not occur if you are on PeopleTools 8.55.15+.  I was told that there were significant changes with the Event Mapping Framework in 8.55.15 and it is possible that this issue does not occur in that Tools release.\n\nCan you please let me know which Tools that you are experiencing this issue on?",
