  "message": "I'm running tools 8.55.17 and when I login I get the custom page, but the PeopleCode doesn't seem to be firing.  If I select email or text nothing pops up. If I login first and navigate to the 2FA page via menu it does work, so not sure what the difference is.  Also I am able to specify a different page in the address bar and get there, but I think that's because no PeopleCode.  Any thoughts on what may cause this?",
