  "message": "After activating the new sign on PeopleCode, I always bounce all of my app and web servers and clear my app/web cache.  I believe that only an app server bounce is required for new sign on PeopleCode to work, but I just do it all for good measure.  If you have already done this and it still seems that the sign on PeopleCode is not firing, then try placing a sqlexec statement in the sign on PeopleCode and writing to a temp table.  This will ensure whether or not the code is firing.  Also, you will only get redirected for 2FA if you are logging in as a user that has the \"Peoplesoft Administrator\" role on their user profile.  Please let me know if any of this has resolved your issue.",
