  "message": "Love this project.  I started implementing it on several of our pages and it worked great!  However, this is an issue with PeopleTools.  Apparently if you implement event mapping and make changes via an app package PC, then the page activate (and also pre and post build PC I believe) PC does not fire at all.  Oracle acknowledges the bug and states it will be fixed in 8.55.12 or 8.56.  Unfortunately, neither of those are happening anytime soon (we're on 8.55.06).  Document ID 2213313.1",
