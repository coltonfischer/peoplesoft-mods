  "message": "The org/apache/commons/codec/binary/Base32 class existed in the delivered Java on the app server that I developed this solution in.  This was on an app server running Tools 8.55.  Which PeopleTools version are you running? Does the %PS_HOME%\\class\\ directory on the server contain all of the delivered JAR files?  If this directory has been altered to where the org/apache/commons/codec/binary/Base32 class was removed, then that could be why this is happening.",
