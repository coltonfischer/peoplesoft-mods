  "message": "Hello Colton,\r\nIf I load and test the POC Google Authenticator Project (PSM_GAUTH_POC) is there a prerequisite of implementing any other of your Two-Factor Authentication projects; i.e., Setting up Two-Factor Authentication (PSM_2FA_POC) and/or Using the Event Mapping Framework to Enforce Two-Factor Authentication (PSM_2FA-EVENT_MAPPING_POC)?  Are each of the projects mentioned considered standalone?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nSteve",
