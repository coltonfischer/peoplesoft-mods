  "message": "I have not had to deal with any sort of licensing when I have used Google Authentication to generate Time-Based One-Time Passwords.  My understanding of Oracle Authenticator is that it implements the same algorithm as other TOTP generating applications.  This means that Oracle Authenticator should work the same as other apps like Google Authenticator, FreeOTP, Authy, etc.  \r\n\r\nThe safety of using the TOTP technique for enforcing multi-factor authentication really depends on your implementation.  The biggest risk that I have found with TOTP MFA is losing the shared secret key on the client or server.  If the client “loses” their secret key, then you will need to have a secure process to verify the user’s identity and provision them a new secret key.  If the server reveals/loses a user’s secret key, then the user’s second factor for authentication should be considered compromised and a new secret key should be provisioned.  \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to application security, there is never really a silver bullet and using TOTPs for MFA is no exception.  Please let me know if you have any other questions and I will be happy to answer.",
