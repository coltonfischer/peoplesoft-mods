  "message": "Hi Colton,\r\n\r\nVery informative, great way to do the customization to the login page.\r\n\r\nDid this for the current project I am on and we did run into a few things, when we removed the background as they wanted white, the text and the borders on the text boxes were all wrong, created a little JS function to alter the CSS on the fly (10 different CSS styles needed changes) and it worked like a charm.\r\n\r\nI also added some additional code to handle the branding of the timeout page as well with the same script.\r\n\r\nThanks again",
