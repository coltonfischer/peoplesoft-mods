  "message": "Hi Paul,\n\nI do not mind sharing this project at all!  I actually thought I provided a link to the source App Designer project in this post, but I was mistaken.  I've created <a href=\"http://www.peoplesoftmods.com/uncategorized/poc-google-authenticator-project/\">a separate post here</a> that has a link to the app designer project with instructions on getting it up and running.  I have only tested this project on 8.55.06 and 8.55.08 Tools, but it should work well (hopefully better) with the Tools that you are on.  Please let me know your experiences with this project if you have a chance to play with it.  \n\n\nThanks,\nColton",
