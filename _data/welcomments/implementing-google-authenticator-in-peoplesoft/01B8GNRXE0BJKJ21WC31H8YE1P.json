  "message": "Hi Kiran,\n\nThis can be implemented on 8.53, but you will have to customize the delivered pre build events of the components that you want to enforce 2FA on.  I suppose this is not too big of an issue if you plan on enforcing 2FA a few components, but anything more than that will create a lot of maintenance overhead.  Your organization would really need to weigh the security benefits vs the overhead costs with implementing this solution.  Once you get on 8.55 the overhead costs would no longer be a concern, because you will be able to leverage event mapping to implement this solution.\n\nIf you are interested in implementing this in your 8.53 environment, then you can <a href=\"http://www.peoplesoftmods.com/2fa/poc-google-authenticator-project/\">check out this post</a> where I provide a code sample to get this solution working in pre-8.55 environments.",
