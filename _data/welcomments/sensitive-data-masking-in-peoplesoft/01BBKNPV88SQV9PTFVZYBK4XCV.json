  "message": "Hi Harsha, thanks for the kind words.  I'd be interested in better understanding the needs of your client and how this tool can potentially be a solution.  I do not mind sharing technical details of this project.  Most of the major technical aspects of this project have been discussed in granular detail in other posts on this blog.  If you would like for me to go into detail on a particular aspect of this project, then just let me know what it is that you are interested in understanding.  I can try my best to explain it here or I can make future blog post if needed.",
