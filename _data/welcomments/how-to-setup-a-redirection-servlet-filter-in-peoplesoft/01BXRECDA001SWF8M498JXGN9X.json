Thanks for sharing the projects  \r\nWe have a scenario where self-service user is presented a custom user profile page after the 2FA is done; they need to complete all sections of the page before they access any other pages in the system. I am wondering we can use the same solution you provided here (to have a token, that can be programmatically set after the user completes the form otherwise it brings them back to this a custom user profile page â€“ Does this approach looks OK ?",
