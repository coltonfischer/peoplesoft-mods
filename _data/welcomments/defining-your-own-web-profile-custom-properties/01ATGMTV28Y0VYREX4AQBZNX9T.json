I am not sure if you already know about this, but there is a nice extension for Chrome browsers called <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ps-utilities/jajoopnifcliapcngocgiidifkmboemc?hl=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">PS Utilities</a> that is capable of giving you the record and field names of values on PeopleSoft pages.  With this utility, you can simply put your mouse over a value on the page and it will tell you the corresponding record and field.  This is much easier to do versus getting this information through app designer.",
