  "message": "There is a clickable link at the beginning of this post (labeled \"CLICK HERE\") that contains all of the source code to implement the solution that I have demonstrated in this post.  This includes the source of the DataMaskingFilterClass.  Please let me know if the link is not working for you and I will fix it.\n\nIf you plan on implementing this data masking servlet filter, then I would also suggest <a href=\"http://www.peoplesoftmods.com/servlet-filters/response-compression-with-custom-servlet-filters/\">implementing this compression servlet filter</a> as well.  If you plan implementing both of these, then make sure that you make the compression filter be the first filter specified in the web.xml's filter chain.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other question.",
