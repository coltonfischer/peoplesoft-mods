  "message": "I have not experienced event mapping code not getting invoked on Components with search records.  The only issue I ever experienced with event mapping code not firing was due to the bug described in My Oracle Support Doc ID 2171391.1, but this bug was fixed in PeopleTools 8.55.11.  Sasank did a great write up of this bug on his blog here: https://pe0ples0ft.blogspot.com/2016/10/emf-hello-world-and-quirks.html.\n\nYou may be experience this bug if you are on a dot release before 8.55.11.  If you are on 8.55.11+, then I would suggest opening a case with My Oracle Support and hopefully they can help you out.",
