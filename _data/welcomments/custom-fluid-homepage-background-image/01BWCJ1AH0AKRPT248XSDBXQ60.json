  "message": "I received the message \"The imported image size exceeds the recommended maximum image size of 32,000 bytes.\" when I uploaded the image into App Designer.  I clicked OK and it still let me save and use the image object.  It appears that having image sizes less than 32,000 bytes is a recommendation and not a requirement.  However, it is possible that your database has a limit on the sizes of images that it will store. If this is the case, then you will need to use smaller image sizes or configure your database to allow storage of larger images.  I hope this helps.",
