  "message": "Thank you very much, I will implement it right away.  I am very curious how you figured that out so quickly?  I have found ways to get most objects but there always seems to be a few  things that I can not seem to figure out.  I thought your section on \"Understanding %metadata Keys\" would be what I have been looking for but for some reason I am not getting the same error message you are which would tell me what methods I am missing.   Again Thank you very much",
