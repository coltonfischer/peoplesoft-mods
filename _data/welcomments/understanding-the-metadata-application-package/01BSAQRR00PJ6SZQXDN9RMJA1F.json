  "message": "I am not aware of a way for App Designer to tell me which methods exist for a %metadata class.  I am only aware of how to get App Designer tell me which methods <em>don’t</em> exist.   This is done by guessing a method name, saving the code, and see if App Designer barks.  It is a painful process, but the “method name guessing game” becomes easier the more you work with the %metadata package. I find that methods are similarly named among the different %metadata classes.\n\nThe error message in the “Understanding %metadata Keys” section is a trick that I use to determine the %metadata method parameter types.  The trick is to extend the given %metadata class methods and then App Designer will tell you if you supply the incorrect input parameter types for the methods.  However, you still have to know the method names for this to be of use.",
