  "message": "I have never come across the issue of the code not working after the service tested successfully with the service operation tester.  The error that you are getting is a generic one that could be caused by many different things.  I would first like to better understand how you are using this solution.  \n\nIn this post, I did not provide any solution/guidance on how to incorporate Nexmo's SMS API into a two-factor authentication solution.  So I am a little unsure when you say \"I am providing option as cell phone\".  It sounds like you have incorporated the code samples from this post into a two-factor authentication solution that sends TOTPs via SMS.  Is this correct?  What have been your experiences with firing the code provided in this post in a standalone manner?  Meaning, do you get the same error when you place this code behind a push button on a simple (non-2FA) page?\n\nI am glad that you are making use of this code and would really like to help you get this working.  Please provide me some more details by answering the questions above and hopefully we can get this working.",
