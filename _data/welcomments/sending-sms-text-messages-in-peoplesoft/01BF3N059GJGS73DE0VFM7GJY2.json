  "message": "Hello Sree.  Good to know that you solved your Nexmo communication issue. As for how did I create the app designer project, I assume you are referring to how I created the necessary objects needed to consume a REST web service from PeopleSoft?  There are some different ways to consume 3rd party web services in PeopleSoft and this example uses document-based messaging with Integration Broker for the communication.  To do this, I had to create the following in the PeopleSoft PIA:\n\nDocuments\nMessages\nService\nService operation\nPeopleCode Program\n\nThere are some really good examples on creating the necessary objects for REST web services in PeopleSoft.  Here is <a href=\"http://www.cedarhillsgroup.com/knowledge-base/kbarticles/PeopleSoft-REST-web-service-start-to-finish\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">one by Chris Malek</a> and here is <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-create-post-json-rest-api-peoplesoft-jose-ponce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">another by Jose Ponce</a>.  The only thing that you want to do differently is uncheck the “Is Provider” checkbox when you are creating the service since you are consuming a service and not providing one.  Here are a couple of PeopleBook references that may be helpful as well:\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E58500_01/pt854pbh1/eng/pt/tibr/task_ManagingConsumerRESTServiceOperations-627ffc.html#topofpage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Managing Consumer REST Service Operations</a>\n<a href=\"https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E58500_01/pt854pbh1/eng/pt/tibr/task_UsingPeopleCodetoManageRESTServiceOperations-b48000.html#topofpage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Using PeopleCode to Manage REST Service Operations</a>\n\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.",
