  "message": "Thank you for the blog with so much of details - I am implementing your solution for our self serviice users \r\n After the user is authenticated , I am redirecting the user to custom \"2 factor authentication\" page.. This is happening from part of sign-on peoplecode func-lib  . We see some body can interject/hack and bypass 2 factor page (with the url manipulation) . Is it possible to add a role for self service user using Peoplecode only after complete the  2 factor page successfully (until that time user has only access to 2 factor page only) I appreciate your input/comment",
