  "message": "Thanks a lot Colton. You Got it. It was the hosts file which is a culprit. \r\nEarlier, though I made the entry in hosts file it did not get effect. The approach I followed to make hosts entry was wrong. \r\n\r\nAs I did not have the access to make entry directly, I did the following which caused the issue.\r\n1. Open hosts file in C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts via notepad editor and make the entry as below.\r\n 99.999.999.99 myhost..us-west-2.compute.internal\r\n2. while saving save it in my desktop, as I did not have permission to save it in etc folder.\r\n3. Now delete the original hosts file in etc folder.\r\n4. Copy and paste the hosts files saved from my desktop to etc folder.\r\n\r\nAs I followed above steps, the file at desktop got saved as a text file, which I did not noticed. This is the reason the entry did not get picked up by system.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing your response, I analyzed and found it not in original format, by comparing with my local machine.\r\n\r\nI opened the file in desktop which I saved earlier. This time I select option save as and given the file name with in double quotes as \"hosts\" and hit the save button. Now I replaced the file under etc folder.\r\n\r\nThat/s all, it got resolved.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your response, which helped to resolve this issue.",
