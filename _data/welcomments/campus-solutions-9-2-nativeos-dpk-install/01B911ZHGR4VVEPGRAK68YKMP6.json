I would suggest that you go <a href=\"http://psadmin.io/community/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">check out the psadmin.io community</a> and ask your question there.  There are a ton of knowledgeable folks over there and I am sure that someone in that community would be able to answer your question.  Also, <a href=\"http://psadmin.io/courses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">these video series'</a> might give you a better understanding of what is and isnâ€™t possible with the PeopleSoft DPK. Sorry that I am not much help and I hope that you can find the answer to your question.",
