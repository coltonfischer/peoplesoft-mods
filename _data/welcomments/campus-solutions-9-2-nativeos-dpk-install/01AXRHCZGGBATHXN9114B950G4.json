  "message": "Hi Raghu,\n\nI do not have any experience with the Virtual Box install option so I cannot comment on the errors that you are getting with that. I am also not sure with how to create a control file or how you can pickup on the database creation step of the native OS DPK install option.  If you run puppet apply again and keep getting the same error, then I would suggest doing a clean uninstall and starting over.",
