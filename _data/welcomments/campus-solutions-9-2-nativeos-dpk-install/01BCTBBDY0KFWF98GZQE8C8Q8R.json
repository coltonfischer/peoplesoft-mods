Thanks for your time and effort.\r\n\r\nI am tried everything that you have mentioned above for CS 9.2 installation in my laptop.\r\nOnly obstacle is I don't see any Oracle related services in my Services windows.

Is there any step that I did wrongly?\r\n\r\nYour help would be really appreciated.\r\nThank you.",
