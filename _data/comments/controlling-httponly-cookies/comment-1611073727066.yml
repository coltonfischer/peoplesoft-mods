message: "Just discovered that I could not set the flags of two or more distinct cookies. Only the last cookie in the list ends up being set.\r\n\r\nApparently, any subsequent calls to SetHeader() to set a new Set-Cookie header will just overwrite the previous Set-Cookie header.\r\n\r\nI wish there were an AddHeader() method to append new Set-Cookie headers instead of overwriting the previous one.\r\n\r\nHave already bookmarked your awesome site!"
