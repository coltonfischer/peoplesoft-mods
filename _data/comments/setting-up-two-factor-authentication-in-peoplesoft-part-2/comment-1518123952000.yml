  Hi Kim.  Yes, unfortunately something with newer Tools releases has caused
  this solution to be insecure.  My previous findings indicated that the
  insecurity only seemed to revolve around Fluid pages.  I was never able to
  bypass the 2FA page when pasting in a URL to a Classic page. However, given
  that you are on such a new Tools version, I would not recommend that you use
  this solution.  It does not seem that Oracle intends us to use the
  SetAuthenticationResult function's ResultDoc parameter as a protection measure
  for application access (even though this technique seemed to work very well in
  older Tools).  


  In 8.55+ Tools, I recommend using <a
  href="http://www.peoplesoftmods.com/2fa/using-the-event-mapping-framework-to-enforce-two-factor-authentication/">Event
  Mapping to inject Component Pre-Build code to enforce 2FA at the
  Component-level</a> rather than at login time.  This technique may not be very
  feasible to adopt depending on your business requirements.  Another (more
  challenging) option is to use a servlet filter to redirect users to perform
  2FA when they request URL resources that require an additional authentication
  factor.  <a

  filters here</a>.
