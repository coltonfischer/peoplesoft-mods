  Hey Colton,  I actually sent a message earlier and I found some information
  basically answering that message.  I also see a post in the stream from my
  colleague AB Krishna.  It is appears that he may have a different
  question.     But I see that the companies using 8.55 tools are experiencing a
  similar problem that we noticed;  which is, if a user has successfully logged
  into the PSoft login page and gets redirected to the 2FA page they are able to
  paste a URL up in the browser and get out of the 2FA page.   I am curious as
  to whether or not it will make a difference if the pages we use for
  self-service are only classic or classic plus pages.  Will this prevent
  someone from getting too far into the application.  We are using the Fluid
  Homepage but maybe if the other permissions are for classic pages maybe that
  is all the further they could get if they try to bypass.    Just wondering if
  you have seen any other results or if you have come up with anyways to block
  it.    We are on 8.56.01
