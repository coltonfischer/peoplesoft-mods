  Hi Jason.  I think Role definition management is a great use case for the
  %metadata package.  I just updated the post with an example of how to assign a
  Permission List to a Role definition using the %metadata package.  Please see
  the "Another Complete %metadata Example" section above.  Let me know if you
  have any other questions.
