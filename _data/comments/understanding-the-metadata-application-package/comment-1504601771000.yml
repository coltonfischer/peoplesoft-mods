  Thank you very much, I will implement it right away.  I am very curious how
  you figured that out so quickly?  I have found ways to get most objects but
  there always seems to be a few  things that I can not seem to figure out.  I
  thought your section on "Understanding %metadata Keys" would be what I have
  been looking for but for some reason I am not getting the same error message
  you are which would tell me what methods I am missing.   Again Thank you very
  much
