  You're welcome! I'm glad it was helpful.  I am not sure if you already know
  about this, but there is a nice extension for Chrome browsers called <a
  href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ps-utilities/jajoopnifcliapcngocgiidifkmboemc?hl=en"
  rel="nofollow">PS Utilities</a> that is capable of giving you the record and
  field names of values on PeopleSoft pages.  With this utility, you can simply
  put your mouse over a value on the page and it will tell you the corresponding
  record and field.  This is much easier to do versus getting this information
  through app designer.
