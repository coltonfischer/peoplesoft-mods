message: "Hello Yogesh.  I am not sure if there is a required image format, but I've had success with both png and jpg image formats. As for dimensions, I would image the larger the better.  \r\n\r\nThe second example in this post is a png with dimensions of 1920x1080 and it seems to work well.  Here is the link to the image for reference: https://www.sanmartinescrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/website-design-background.png"
