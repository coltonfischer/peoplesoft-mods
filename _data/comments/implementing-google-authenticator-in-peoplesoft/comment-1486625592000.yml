  Hi Kiran,


  This can be implemented on 8.53, but you will have to customize the delivered
  pre build events of the components that you want to enforce 2FA on.  I suppose
  this is not too big of an issue if you plan on enforcing 2FA a few components,
  but anything more than that will create a lot of maintenance overhead.  Your
  organization would really need to weigh the security benefits vs the overhead
  costs with implementing this solution.  Once you get on 8.55 the overhead
  costs would no longer be a concern, because you will be able to leverage event
  mapping to implement this solution.


  If you are interested in implementing this in your 8.53 environment, then you
  can <a

  out this post</a> where I provide a code sample to get this solution working
  in pre-8.55 environments.
