message: "Hello Colton,\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful article for PeopleSoft installations. I was almost done with the setting up of PeopleSoft in my system. But services are not starting properly. While installing got an warning from antivirus which i have in my system. Not if i forcefully try to start it says \"OracleOraDB12cHomeTNSListener service on local computer started and stopped'. some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs.\" Does antivirus protecting those services to run? Please advise on this. Thanks much!\r\n\r\n-Raja"
