  I don’t believe that I have experienced any issues like this.  I have also
  never tried passing in a custom value for ps_cfg_home in the
  psft_customizations.yaml file.  The only custom value that I have ever fed to
  it is the db_port.  Do you have this issue when you do not specify a
  ps_cfg_home value in the psft_customizations.yaml file?
